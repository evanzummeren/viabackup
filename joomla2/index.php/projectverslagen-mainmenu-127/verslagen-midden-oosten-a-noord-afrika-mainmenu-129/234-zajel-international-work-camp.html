<p><em>By Branka. Palestina, 2012.</em></p>
<p>This was honestly one of the most interesting experiences of my life. Working alongside, exchanging experiences and views with the local volunteers and staff was wonderful. If anything, these moments gave me a real insight into the life of Palestinians.</p>
 
<p>Everybody was welcoming, warm and engaged, which made the exchange of views and experiences much more fun and interesting. I have made lasting friendships I cherish deeply. I have especially learned a lot from Alaa (the main coordinator of Zajel), but also the guides that accompanied us during the excursions, the local speakers and volunteers. They have given us a unique view or perspective on the conflict, lives and everyday troubles that so many people face here in Palestine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even though I was very nervous about giving the workshops before coming, it turned out to be a wonderful and educational experience, though it was a challenge to leave behind the feelings and thoughts of the morning visits. The students and the work itself supplied the energy and motivation to always make the most out of the time we had. It was wonderful to see how the students were holding back at first, shy and reserved. But after only one workshop you could see them opening up and participate more actively. After a week there was significant progress for all students. We got the quietest girl to do a presentation; she even was the moderator at the UN-themed workshop we gave! After a few workshops we got new students who had heard that it was great from others. I can’t tell you how much this meant to me. The feeling that even with so little we made a connection, some kind of difference. The intercultural exchange was a prominent and important part in all this.</p>
<p>The last class was organized as a goodbye workshop. Each of us told the students about our respective countries and cultures and shared gifts and sweets. This was a nice and fitting goodbye. In the end it was the students that made it what it was; they are so warm, kind, open, just wonderful! I am truly going to miss them…</p>
<p>By working with and talking to the local volunteers and students I really got what I wished for. I’m most thankful to organizers Ismat, Alaa and Wasseem, who all opened their hearts and minds to me, who were so very frank and sharing, and gave me the best insight and feel for the life there. But all the local volunteers were very welcoming. They helped us any way they could with the workshops, but basically, with any question we had. They volunteered information about their lives, the West Bank, Palestine, the settlers, their views. Most, if not all, spoke excellent English, which made the communication between us very easy. They all helped me with my Arabic, and where very patient with my many, many questions. They not only learned me a language, but a culture.</p>
<p>The small things showed me a lot about how on a cultural and traditional level, we are different, but also alike. The talks to coffee shop owners, people on the streets of Bethlehem and the kids on the streets at for instance the Balata refugee camp, were touching, and educational too in the sense that it taught me a people’s mind, a people’s world, a Palestine of many faces, wishes, hopes and dreams, fears, scars, and traumas.</p>
<p><img src="../../../via-media/content/verslagen/mocana/branka-in-palestina/balata&#32;refugeecamp.jpg" border="0" alt="balata refugeecamp" width="420" height="332" style="margin: 2px; float: left;" />The trips to Hebron, Bethlehem, Sebastia, Balata, Nablus, Yanun, the detention center in Al Fara, and the many other villages and places were well chosen. Especially Hebron was shocking, but interesting. The tensions between settlers and Palestinians and the army are so tangible there. The presence of the army is a everyday reality, but for me mostly very strange and horrible. What I found interesting were the personal stories and experiences that were shared with us there. These gave me a direct connection to life lived, to experiences and feelings, to grief and disbelief from a local perspective. Very special.</p>
<p>These trips, though sometimes too short and too many in a day, were important, difficult, beautiful, interesting, shocking, poignant and saddening. They showed us the many faces of conflict, but also of daily life and hopes. I think these are the paradoxes every Palestinian lives with every day. I think, though I can’t speak for everybody, this was very well done and certainly a very important part of the camp.</p>
<p>However. The constant ‘guiding’ of our movements, access, the many restrictions, but mostly the <em>way</em> this was done, the <em>way</em> we were addressed, sometimes put ashadow over the experience. I eventually just accepted it, but it kept annoying me during the trips. Let me say clearly that I understand their logic behind this, namely our safety, and the reputation of the Zajel project. But I feel, this can be done in a way that would not make me feel uncomfortable and annoyed.</p>
<p>The accommodations were beyond expectation. The apartment was so nice and luxurious, it made the homecoming after the sometimes difficult days very comfortable. The rooms are very nice with excellent beds, also the showers, kitchen, washing machine etc are all in good shape. Thank you for your hospitality.</p>
<p>Finally, as said, this trip was many things. It was very difficult at times. The infringing settlements, outposts, checkpoints, poverty and despair: so many things that I faced for only a short while, have shocked and perplexed me to the core. Mostly I am very confused and disappointed in the way hatred, greed, and fanaticism are in people’s minds and have taken a life of their own. How can this go on? Where is the sense of humanism, of caring for your neighbors instead of killing and oppressing them? An average person would perhaps call this naive, but for me, it’s a deep and honest interest in people and their motivations, their views and feelings. I had hoped to maybe understand the why of this horrible situation, but sometimes I feel am farther from any truth to this answer than ever.</p>
