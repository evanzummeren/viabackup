			Tent of Nations, West Bank - 2004		</h2>








<p>Een bizarre ervaring om te verblijven op een plek met aan de ene kant zoveel historische en bijbelse waarde en aan de andere kant het lijden van de Palestijnse bevolking onder de Isrealische bezetting.</p>
<p> </p>
 
<strong>Discovering Bethlehem - April 2004<br /><br /></strong>During two weeks I worked as a volunteer in the project Tent of Nations and on the land (Daher’s Vineyard). These two weeks were a mixture of everything. I worked both in the office in Bethlehem and on the land near Nahalin. I met many family members of Daoud and young Palestinians and everybody has his own interesting story. It was a wonderful experience to be in Bethlehem and surroundings, on one hand because of the enormous historic and Biblical value (you can almost smell this if you go around), on the other hand to really see and feel the suffering of the people, which you usually only watch on tv (if you watch the right channels).<br /><br />The office work existed of many different things. We often sat down and discussed with Daoud and a Swiss volunteer about the project. We had many ideas and tried to work them out. We talked about a puppet theatre to be performed by the youth group, about programs for workcamps, about trying to involve more people, etc.<br /><br />In The Netherlands I work for a peace organisation, that organises many workcamps. It is an international organisation (SCI) and it also has a partner in Palestine (IPYL). One day I started the adventure to visit them in Al Khelil (Hebron), together with the Swiss volunteer. We had to change taxi's for 5 times, because of roadblocks. Still we were very lucky to arrive there so quickly, because many Palestinians were less lucky and were standing in a line in the sun, waiting for their ID and the answer if they could pass or not.<br /><br />The People of IPYL showed us around in Hebron and they were also very interested in the project Tent of Nations. I really hope we can start some cooperation and hopefully organise a workcamp on the land together, in autumn.<br /><br />Of course all these are only plans. You never know something for sure here. One day for example two visitors from Switzerland came to Bethlehem and wanted to work a day on the land. We planned to go to the land all together, however, that day the Israeli put a curfew on the cities surrounding Bethlehem and closed Bethlehem itself. So we stayed in the office, the whole day. I only went out to the market and the shop to buy a pretty large quantity of food. You never know if you might need it. Since the 40 days curfew most Palestinians store enough food in their houses to survive for some weeks.<br /><br />To get to the land was anyway not always easy during my stay. Apparently it was even worse than usual, judging on the remarks of Daoud and others, who have plenty of experience with this trip. It is only a few kilometres from Bethlehem, but it is not possible to get there with your own car. Nobody can leave Bethlehem with his own car, because the roads are blocked. Sometimes this means that soldiers prevent you from leaving, but in many cases it means that the road is ‘blocked’ in the most exact use of the word: bulldozers have completely destroyed the road and you have to pass a hill towards the other side of the road. Only cars with yellow (Israeli) license plates are allowed to drive outside Bethlehem.<br /><br />With foreign passports it was usually no problem, but the Palestinians were refused several times. Luckily Daoud’s brother Daher, often stays at the land for many days. It is necessary to have somebody on the land, because the plants need to be watered and the chicken, the rabbit and the dog need to be fed. Daher’s wife and children are of course less happy with this situation, because they hardly see him at home.<br /><br />I can really understand that many Palestinians decide to abandon their fields and stop cultivating them. If you see how difficult it is to even reach the land, not even to speak about carrying tools, etc. And when the grapes are harvested, they need to be transported quickly to the market. This is not possible if you have to wait at checkpoints for hours. And the final problem is there basically is no market for the products. There are more vegetables in Bethlehem than the Palestinians can afford to buy.<br /><br />Taking all this into account I have to say I really respect Daoud for the consistency in his work and his struggle. ‘We cannot give up!’ he usually says. Even though the situation sometimes looks so miserable and hopeless. But despite that, I also experienced so many ‘lights’ during my stay: new plans were created, Palestinans became enthusiastic, international visitors came to the land, new contacts were made, fields were cleared. I think this fight for keeping the land and the project to organise activities for the youth and have cultural exchanges is a very good stimulation for other people not to give up hope.<br /><br />I would advise anyone who is around to take a look at the land. Once you are there, you forget totally about the situation you are in. The view is tremendous, it is quiet and peaceful. The only things that remind you of the occupation are the settlements all around and the helicopters that fly over sometimes. I loved the work on the land. The area is so big that you sometimes don’t see anyone else and you really feel a king in the holy land. The Olive trees were full of young fruits and also the almond trees were already loaded. There will be a lot of work during the harvest time! I cleaned fields with recently planted grapes and olive trees, we built stone walls around one of the caves, we cleaned some new fields, watered the plants, fed the animals, played with the dog. In the evenings we made tea and roasted bread on the fire and sat together. I had a wonderful time.<br /><br />Also in Bethlehem I was never bored. Daoud and his family invited me all the time. Daoud’s sister Amal took us once to a refugee camp, Duheisheh camp, and showed us a youth centre that was built there. She also showed us around in the Caritas hospital where she works. We attended the birthday party of Daoud’s daughter Shadin, and visited the sick mother of a young Palestinian. Bethlehem is always full of people, full of markets and full of shops. People are all so kind and hospitality is the first thing you discover in Palestine. I was invited for Arabic coffee so many times.<br /><br />The last thing I want to mention is the preparations we made to sell some products on the land. We collected glass and plastic jars, made labels and will fill them with almonds, olives, olive oil, raisins, Za’atar and Miryamia. Also some small olive wood souvenirs from the Tent of Nations and Daher’s Vineyard have been made by a youth group member. It was so nice to work on this and I think this is a nice new activity. Future aim is to involve the people from the village more in the project, so that also their products can be sold (for example honey). The products will be sold in small quantities and for a small profit, as little souvenirs for the visitors.<br /><br />Although it is difficult to plan anything ahead and a lot depends on the situation of the day, I still think so much is achieved already in this project and I hope it will keep on growing. Before I left The Netherlands, many people were sceptic about my trip. Some thought it would be dangerous, others found it useless. Of course I did not expect to achieve peace in the Middle East in two weeks time, but still I think this project makes a nice contribution towards it. Respect, understanding and solidarity are the basics for peace.
